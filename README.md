# React Native Navigation Fun

Just a playground for me to test and experiment with React-Native and React-Navigation

## Learning paths (with resources for references):

Step 1: Simple navigation setup. Screen to screen with modal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hLQURJM7ws&ab_channel=LogRocket

Step 2: Passing Params: https://reactnavigation.org/docs/params

Step 3: Add a Header to the views. 

Step 4: Drawer Navigation. https://reactnavigation.org/docs/drawer-based-navigation

Step 5: Nesting Navigators. https://reactnavigation.org/docs/nesting-navigators/
